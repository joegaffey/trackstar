# TrackStar

Get out on that track and show them what you can do!


Inspired by top down racers like [Circuit Superstars](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097130/Circuit_Superstars/) and [Ultimate Racing 2D](https://store.steampowered.com/app/808080/Ultimate_Racing_2D/), borrowing physics code from [car.js.org](https://car.js.org/) and using [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) framework.


Use touch, arrows or WASD keys to drive. Enjoy!
